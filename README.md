# Meridian Web Components
This repository is an experiment with creating UI components with web standards like `lit-html` and Shadow DOM.

## Developing
To get started developing you'll need npm to install dependencies and to run a development server with `live-server`.
```
npm install -g live-server
git clone git@github.com:eriklharper/meridian-web-components.git
cd meridian-web-components
npm install
live-server
Server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```
